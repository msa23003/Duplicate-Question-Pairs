# Duplicate Question Pairs Predictor

This Streamlit application predicts whether two questions are duplicates or not using a pre-trained machine learning model. The app is designed to help identify similar or identical questions, which is particularly useful in platforms like Q&A websites to avoid redundant content.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple input fields to enter two questions.
- **Real-Time Prediction:** Provides instant feedback on whether the questions are duplicates.
- **Streamlit Powered:** The application is built using Streamlit, ensuring a responsive and interactive experience.
